This contains rebuilt/marginally modified Twitch, Steam and Discord libraries. As we wanted the libraries to run on Linux with .NET Core, and not all of these libraries had a .NET Core release, I just made a few minor modifications for that purpose.

This is in a separate repository since they have different licenses. Check the respective projects for the licenses applicable for each.
